# Distill Templates

This is the repository for the distill web framework. If you're interesting in just using the framework to write an article, visit http://distill.pub/guide/. If you're interested in submitting pull requests or developing on the framework itself, read on.

## Development

Run `yarn start` to start a watching build rollup server. To view the sample pages in the repo, you can run `yarn serve` as a separate process which starts a static server. `yarn build` will run a one-time build.

## Testing

Run `yarn test`. That's it.
